# Tailwind CSS Flex Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS involving unexpected overflow in a flex container despite using `space-x-4` to space items.  The bug is subtle and might only appear under specific conditions related to content length and screen size.

## Bug Description

The provided code snippet creates a simple flex container with a profile image and user information. While `space-x-4` is used, the container sometimes overflows horizontally, pushing content beyond its parent element's boundaries.

## Solution

The provided solution employs a couple of approaches to fix this:
1. Using `shrink-0` on the elements to prevent them from shrinking below their minimum size. 
2. Adding `flex-shrink-0` to prevent the content from shrinking and overflowing.
